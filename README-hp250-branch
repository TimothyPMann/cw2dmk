This is some extremely unbaked hackery at trying to decode hp250 (7902A/9895K) disks.
All I have to work with is a partial -v7 capture of one disk from RÃ¼diger Kurth and
an hp250 service handbook he sent me.  The handbook doesn't say the disks are MMFM,
but it appears that way, as a histogram has *4* peaks rather than just 3, with the
4th being a bit weak.
PDF page 450 of the handbook has some physical disk format info, but doesn't say
what the address marks look like (data bits or modified clock bits).

OUT_RAW has been moved from 6 to 8, but it won't work right there because
output from level 7 will pollute it.  Maybe OUT_RAW should go away.

OUT_HISTOGRAM is new, and is now 6.  This shows a histogram for every track.
This feature could be mainstreamed.  It would be nice to merge with
do_histogram, to include and log its peak finder.  Peak finder should look
for up to 4 peaks for MMFM; currently it still only looks for 3.

There is no address mark detection or valid mmfm clock pattern checking so far.
One totally bogus hack tries to align the start of the first track by assuming
the data is 00 with normal clocking.

OUT_HISTOGRAM also outputs the clock pattern for each decoded data byte,
preceding it in parentheses.  Something like this could be useful to mainstream,
maybe.  Or maybe logging the clock and data bits still interleaved would be
better.
