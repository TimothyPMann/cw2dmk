This branch has a kludgy start at decoding HP250 (7902A/9895K) disks.
All I have to work with is a partial -v7 capture of one disk from
RÃ¼diger Kurth, an HP250 service handbook he sent me, and various
things found on the web.  PDF page 450 of the handbook has some
physical disk format info, but doesn't say what the address marks look
like (data bits or modified clock bits).  Peeking at the python code
in https://github.com/brouhaha/fluxtoimd was helpful in figuring out
what the address marks and some other oddities, such as bytes being
recorded in little-endian order.

OUT_HISTOGRAM is new, and is now 6.  This shows a histogram for every
track.  This feature could be mainstreamed.  XXX It would be nice to
merge with do_histogram, to include and log its peak finder.  XXX Peak
finder should look for up to 4 peaks for MMFM; currently it still only
looks for 3.

As a drawback, adding OUT_HISTOGRAM bumped up the other output formats
by 1, so in particular OUT_SAMPLES becomes 8.  That's not great for
users who are used to the old numbering.  Maybe OUT_HISTOGRAM

OUT_SAMPLES now also outputs the clock pattern for each decoded data
byte, preceding it and separated by a "/".  Something like this could
be useful to mainstream, maybe.  Or maybe logging the clock and data
bits still interleaved would be better.  Or maybe removing it would be
better!

XXX Haven't tested yet that parselog can still parse the log.
