Register documentation and programming hints for PC/ISA Catweasel

Original German document: November 15th, 2001
English translation: December 4th, 2020.

Register map (sorted by number)

0	read/write S-Ram. After every access, the address
	counter will be increased by 1.
1	read: resets address counter, index counter and various
	state machines. Prior to this reset action, all select-lines
	should be deactivated (set to 1), so the index counter
	won't be increased accidently.
	write: (hmm.. obviously does nothing)
2	read: returns contents of the status register
	write: writes to control register. The control
	register is not readable, so software should keep the
	written value in a shadow-register.
3	read: reads version information depending on ram-address counter
	write: various actions depending on ram address counter:
	RA=0	Clock-select. 0=28 Mhz		128=14 Mhz
	RA=1	Write-enable  0=forbid		128=permit
	RA=2	IndexStore    0=dont store	128=do store
4	not used
5	write: Will start writing immediately, won't wait for anything.
	read: reads a track "from Index to Index". 
6	not used
7	write: starts track-write "from Index to Index"
	read: starts reading a track without waiting for anything.

Sorted by actions
Number is register number, W stands for writing, R for reading that register.

RA = Ram-address, "XX --> YW"  write value XX to register Y

Reset RAM address pointer 				1R
Ram-access					  0R or 0W
read status register					2R
write control register					2W
Abort read					1W or	1R
start reading immediately				7R
Start reading index-to-index (wait-for-index)		5R
Abort waiting for an index pulse			1R
Reset index counter					1R
Set Base-clock to 14 Mhz		0-->3W with RA = 0
Set Base-clock to 28 Mhz		128-->3W with RA = 0
set Write-enable-Bit			      3W with RA = 1
reset Write-enable-Bit					1R
allow Index storing:			128-->3W with RA = 2
disable Index storing:			  0-->3W with RA = 2
write immediately (*)					5W
write from Index to Index (*)				7W
Abort writing					1W or	1R
read versions information 		3R with RA=0-15 and
					RA=131072-131087

----

Procedure "allow writing":

1R		[resets address counter, making RA = 0]
3W		[set desired clock rate]
0R		[RA now 1]
128-->3W	[set Write-enable-Bit]
0R		[RA now 2]
0R		[RA now 3]
0R		[RA now 4]
0R		[RA now 5]
0R		[RA now 6]
0R		[RA now 7]
2W		[select drive and density]
5W oder 7W	[depending on desired write mode]

This is assuming that the memory has been prepared with write
data that is properly terminated.

The major version can be used directly, the minor version should be multiplied by 2.
If you are reading these bits:

01.01 

the version number is V1.2. 

--

Read-thresholds from the Amiga versions of the Catweasel in 300RPM drives:

bit-sequence		counter value
01			<28
001			>=28
0001			>=42

These stay unchanged for DD and HD disks: At 14MHz clock, these thresholds
correspond to a bit rate of 500KBit, and with 28MHz, it's 1MBit.

----

Status register bits:
0	Reading		0 while the controller is active reading
1	Writing		0 while the controller is active writing
2	HDin	(*)	status of Pin 2 of the 34-pin Shugart-connector
3	WProt		0 when selected drive has a write-protected disk.
4	TRK0		0 when selected drive is on track 0
5	DChange		0 when selected drive is empty
6	Index		0 when index pulse is passing by
7	reserved	not used

Control register bits:
0	Step
1	Dir
2	Side
3	Motor1		
4	Sel0		drive "before the cable twist"
5	Sel1		drive "after the cable twist"
6	HDin	when in doubt, set to 1, then (*) will be input!
7	Motor0
